Project Title: Text Summarization Using T5 Architecture
Overview
This project focuses on developing an advanced Text Summarization model utilizing the T5 architecture. Our goal is to create efficient and accurate summaries for long text passages using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We explored both extractive and abstractive methods of summarization to understand their strengths and weaknesses in different contexts.

Architecture

üìÑ T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):

We leveraged the T5 model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture, known for its versatility across multiple NLP tasks.
The model treats every task as a text generation problem, enabling seamless adaptation to text summarization.

üí° Implementation Details:

We utilized Google Colab with GPU acceleration to manage the heavy computational requirements.
Python Libraries:
transformers for the T5 model,
datasets for managing and preprocessing data,
rouge-score for evaluating the summaries against human references.

üîç Challenges Faced:

GPU Limitations: Frequent crashes due to RAM constraints required careful memory management and model optimization.
Extractive vs. Abstractive Summarization: While extractive methods provided quick results, abstractive summarization posed unique challenges in maintaining language coherence and context.
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing:

Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization using transformers and datasets.
Model Building:

Implemented the T5 architecture for abstractive summarization.
Extractive methods were also explored using traditional approaches.
Training and Evaluation:

Trained on publicly available datasets using Google Colab with GPU support.
ROUGE scoring was used to evaluate the performance of the summarization models.
Requirements
Python 3.x
transformers: For model implementation.
datasets: For handling large-scale text datasets.
rouge-score: For evaluating text summaries.
Google Colab: Recommended for GPU acceleration.
